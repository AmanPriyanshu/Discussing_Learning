# Discussing_Learning
This repo will mostly be simple articles wherein I explore topics of ML/DL. It won't be in detail but hopefully will help me someday, feel free to contribute if you have any topics you want to discuss.

* [Generalizing](https://github.com/AmanPriyanshu/Discussing_Learning/blob/master/Generalizing_over_a_cup_of_TF.ipynb)

This case talks about Generalization its use case and how it is one of the most important problems faced by Artificial Neural Nets

* [Thinking about Perceptrons](https://github.com/AmanPriyanshu/Discussing_Learning/blob/master/Discussing_the_Perception_of_Perceptrons.ipynb)

This case is simple and talks about Linear and Logistic Regression for a single feature. I don't think this is the best optimization or the most optimal results but definitely something. If you cannot see the GitHub link because somehow .ipynb files do not load take a look at the [Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ZZMGsR8xA2eEqUGrWgSt8EVNoSkdffUm?usp=sharing).

* [Thinking about Multi-Feature Perceptrons]()

Its not completely implemented and I have to check a lot of stuff so am not posting it here.

* [Quantized Acceleration of Neural Networks]()

Implementing Quantization to Accelerate Neural Network Learning. Once a sufficient accuracy is reached remove Quantization and cotinue.

* [Simple Logistic Regression](https://github.com/AmanPriyanshu/Discussing_Learning/blob/master/Logistic_Regression.ipynb)

Implementation of Simple Logistic Regression

* [Naive Bayes](https://github.com/AmanPriyanshu/Discussing_Learning/blob/master/Naive_Bayes_and_K_Means.ipynb)

* [K-Means](https://github.com/AmanPriyanshu/Discussing_Learning/blob/master/Naive_Bayes_and_K_Means.ipynb)

* [AutoEncoders](https://github.com/AmanPriyanshu/Discussing_Learning/blob/master/AutoEncoders.ipynb)
